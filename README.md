- 👋 Hi, I’m @AprilDeFeu
- 👀 I’m interested in physics engines, machine learning, automation, and music. I love coding physics problems and visualizing them, or playing around with sound!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JS, React, and brushing up on C/C++ and C#. I want to learn Front End and build my Full Stack.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can help me learn more and strengthen my overall programming etiquette.
