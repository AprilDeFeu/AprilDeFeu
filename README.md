- 👋 Hi, I’m @AprilDeFeu, B.Sc. in Physics and Comp. Sci., currently a Communications Software Specialist at CAE Inc.
- 👀 I’m interested in simulators and game engines. My current job involves communications systems for pilot training sims, but would also be very interested in doing game physics or shader programming.
- 🌱 In decreasing order of how well I code in them, here's my top programming languages: C/C++, Python, Java, C#, Ocaml, JavaScript, Rust, Kotlin, Go, R, Matlab
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can help me push my skills further as I move forward in my career.
